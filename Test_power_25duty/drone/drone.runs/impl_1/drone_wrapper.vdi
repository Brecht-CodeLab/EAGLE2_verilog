Resolution: Modify the set_property command to apply the property on the correct object type. Since the property is being applied as a scoped constraint, ensure the proper connectivity of the object port objects can be translated into pin objects. This could be due to the insertion of IO Buffers between the top level terminal and cell pin. If the goal is to apply constraints that will migrate to top level ports it is required that IO Buffers manually be instanced.

WARNING: [DRC DPIP-1] Input pipelining: DSP drone_i/SWIPT_2020_0/inst/SWIPT_2020_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/swipt_toplevel_inst/inst_swiptout/pulse_length1 input drone_i/SWIPT_2020_0/inst/SWIPT_2020_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/swipt_toplevel_inst/inst_swiptout/pulse_length1/A[29:0] is not pipelined. Pipelining DSP48 input will improve performance.
WARNING: [DRC DPOP-1] PREG Output pipelining: DSP drone_i/SWIPT_2020_0/inst/SWIPT_2020_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/swipt_toplevel_inst/inst_swiptout/pulse_length1 output drone_i/SWIPT_2020_0/inst/SWIPT_2020_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/swipt_toplevel_inst/inst_swiptout/pulse_length1/P[47:0] is not pipelined (PREG=0). Pipelining the DSP48 output will improve performance and often saves power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this DSP48 function was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set the PREG attribute to 1.
WARNING: [DRC DPOP-2] MREG Output pipelining: DSP drone_i/SWIPT_2020_0/inst/SWIPT_2020_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/swipt_toplevel_inst/inst_swiptout/pulse_length1 multiplier stage drone_i/SWIPT_2020_0/inst/SWIPT_2020_v1_0_S00_AXI_inst/swipt_toplevel_inst/inst_swiptout/pulse_length1/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.
